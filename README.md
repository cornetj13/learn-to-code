# Programming Projects
Here, I am keeping all my personal projects that I am working on to help me develop as a programmer.

These projects are meant to highlight different skills and languages I have been striving to master. Among these projects are:

Car Shop: A simple console application written in C# which explores use of  classes, methods, and Windows Forms GUI. Also implements MVC design pattern.

Animal Classes: A simple excercise in exploring classes, abstract classes, methods, inheritance, and interface. A useful reference for understanding these concepts.

Chess Board Game: An app that models Chess. Explores 2D arrays, among other things.
