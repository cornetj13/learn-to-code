# Programming Projects
Here, I am keeping all my personal projects that I am working on to help me develop as a programmer.

These projects are meant to highlight different skills and languages I have been striving to master. Among these projects are:

# C# projects
Following this amazing course by Shad Sluiter (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhnlrYeDKM8&list=PLhPyEFL5u-i03yjAvWPwYyG6s3K0jH8QX) I have done the following projects:

Car Shop: A simple console application written in C# which explores use of  classes, methods, and Windows Forms GUI. Also implements MVC design pattern.

Animal Classes: A simple excercise in exploring classes, abstract classes, methods, inheritance, and interface. A useful reference for understanding these concepts.

Chess Board Game: An app that models Chess. Explores 2D arrays, among other things.



Minesweeper (Final project): The main goal of this course is to develop Minesweeper on your own using the skills developed during the course. This project is my own work, and is the overarching project I am working on while following this course.
